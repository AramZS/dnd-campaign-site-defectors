<h4 id="great-weapon-fighting" tabindex="-1">Great Weapon Fighting</h4>
<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
<h4 id="protection" tabindex="-1">Protection</h4>

<h3 id="action-surge" tabindex="-1">Action Surge</h3>

<h3 id="martial-archetype" tabindex="-1">Martial Archetype</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques.

<h3 id="extra-attack" tabindex="-1">Extra Attack</h3>

<h4 id="improved-critical" tabindex="-1">Improved Critical</h4>
<p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
<h4 id="remarkable-athlete" tabindex="-1">Remarkable Athlete</h4>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.</p>

<h4 id="superior-critical" tabindex="-1">Superior Critical</h4>

<h4 id="survivor" tabindex="-1">Survivor</h4>
