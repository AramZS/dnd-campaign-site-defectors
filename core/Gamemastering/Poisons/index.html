<p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.</p>
<p>Poisons come in the following four types.</p>
<p><em><strong>Contact</strong></em>. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ingested</strong></em>. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>
<p><em><strong>Inhaled</strong></em>. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>
<p><em><strong>Injury</strong></em>. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p>

<p>Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Assassin's Blood (Ingested)</strong></em>. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.</p>
<p><em><strong>Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled)</strong></em>. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns.

<p><em><strong>Drow Poison (Injury)</strong></em>. This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p>
<p><em><strong>Essence of Ether (Inhaled)</strong></em>. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours.
