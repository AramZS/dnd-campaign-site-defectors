<h3 id="necklace-of-adaptation" tabindex="-1">Necklace of Adaptation</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as <em>cloudkill</em> and <em>stinking cloud</em> effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).</p>
<h3 id="necklace-of-fireballs" tabindex="-1">Necklace of Fireballs</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This necklace has 1d6+3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level <em>fireball</em> spell (save DC 15).</p>
<p>You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the <em>fireball</em> by 1 for each bead beyond the first.</p>
<h3 id="necklace-of-prayer-beads" tabindex="-1">Necklace of Prayer Beads</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</em></p>
<p>This necklace has 1d4+2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.</p>
<p>Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

<h3 id="nine-lives-stealer" tabindex="-1">Nine Lives Stealer</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
<p>The sword has 1d8+1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.</p>
