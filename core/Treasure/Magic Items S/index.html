<h3 id="scarab-of-protection" tabindex="-1">Scarab of Protection</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells.</li>
<li>The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scimitar-of-speed" tabindex="-1">Scimitar of Speed</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.</p>
<h3 id="shield-+1-+2-or-+3" tabindex="-1">Shield, +1, +2, or +3</h3>
<p><em>Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)</em></p>
<p>While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield's rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.</p>
<h3 id="shield-of-missile-attraction" tabindex="-1">Shield of Missile Attraction</h3>
<p><em>Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Curse</strong></em>. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the <em>remove curse</em> spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.</p>
<h3 id="slippers-of-spider-climbing" tabindex="-1">Slippers of Spider Climbing</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.</p>
<h3 id="sovereign-glue" tabindex="-1">Sovereign Glue</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p>
<p>This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with <em>oil of slipperiness</em>. When found, a container contains 1d6+1 ounces.</p>
<p>One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of <em>universal solvent</em> or <em>oil of etherealness</em>, or with a <em>wish</em> spell.</p>
<h3 id="spell-scroll" tabindex="-1">Spell Scroll</h3>
<p><em>Scroll, varies</em></p>
<p>A <em>spell scroll</em> bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.</p>
<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10+the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.</p>
<p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.</p>

</div><p>A wizard spell on a <em>spell scroll</em> can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10+the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the <em>spell scroll</em> is destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="spellguard-shield" tabindex="-1">Spellguard Shield</h3>
<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.</p>
<h3 id="sphere-of-annihilation" tabindex="-1">Sphere of Annihilation</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p>
<p>This 2-foot diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p>
<p>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.</p>
<p>The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.</p>
<p>If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.</p>
<p>If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the <em>gate</em> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a <em>portable hole</em>, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.</p>

</div><h3 id="staff-of-the-python" tabindex="-1">Staff of the Python</h3>
<p><em>Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)</em></p>
<p>You can use an action to speak this staff's command word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor snake under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.</p>
<p>On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.</p>
<p>If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.</p>
<h3 id="staff-of-the-woodlands" tabindex="-1">Staff of the Woodlands</h3>
<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid)</em></p>
<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.</p>
<p>The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spells</strong></em>. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>animal friendship</em> (1 charge), <em>awaken</em> (5 charges), <em>barkskin</em> (2 charges), <em>locate animals or plants</em> (2 charges), <em>speak with animals</em> (1 charge), <em>speak with plants</em> (3 charges), or <em>wall of thorns</em> (6 charges).</p>

<p>The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by <em>detect magic</em>. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.</p>
<h3 id="staff-of-thunder-and-lightning" tabindex="-1">Staff of Thunder and Lightning</h3>
<p><em>Staff, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lightning</strong></em>. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thunder</strong></em>. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lightning Strike</strong></em>. You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thunderclap</strong></em>. You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't deafened.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thunder and Lightning</strong></em>. You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.</p>
<h3 id="staff-of-withering" tabindex="-1">Staff of Withering</h3>
<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)</em></p>
<p>This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

In addition, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage for 1 hour on any ability check or saving throw that uses Strength or Constitution.</p>
<h3 id="stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals" tabindex="-1">Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the <em>conjure elemental</em> spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.</p>
<h3 id="stone-of-good-luck-(luckstone)" tabindex="-1">Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While this polished agate is on your person, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.</p>
<h3 id="sun-blade" tabindex="-1">Sun Blade</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the <em>sun blade</em>.</p>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>
<p>The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.</p>
<h3 id="sword-of-life-stealing" tabindex="-1">Sword of Life Stealing</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, provided that the target isn't a construct or an undead. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.</p>
<h3 id="sword-of-sharpness" tabindex="-1">Sword of Sharpness</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.</p>
<p>When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.</p>
<p>In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.</p>
<h3 id="sword-of-wounding" tabindex="-1">Sword of Wounding</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.</p>
<p>Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.</p>
