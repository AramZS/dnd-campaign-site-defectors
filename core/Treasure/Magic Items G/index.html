<h3 id="gauntlets-of-ogre-power" tabindex="-1">Gauntlets of Ogre Power</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher.</p>
<h3 id="gem-of-brightness" tabindex="-1">Gem of Brightness</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.</li>
<li>The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li>The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.</li>
</ul>
<p>When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.</p>
<h3 id="gem-of-seeing" tabindex="-1">Gem of Seeing</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This gem has 3 charges. As an action, you can speak the gem's command word and expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have truesight out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.</p>
<p>The gem regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<h3 id="giant-slayer" tabindex="-1">Giant Slayer</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any axe or sword), rare</em></p>
<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
<p>When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, &quot;giant&quot; refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.</p>
<h3 id="glamoured-studded-leather" tabindex="-1">Glamoured Studded Leather</h3>
<p><em>Armor (studded leather), rare</em></p>
<p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor's command word and cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.</p>
<h3 id="gloves-of-missile-snaring" tabindex="-1">Gloves of Missile Snaring</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10+your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.</p>
<h3 id="gloves-of-swimming-and-climbing" tabindex="-1">Gloves of Swimming and Climbing</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don't cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.</p>
<h3 id="goggles-of-night" tabindex="-1">Goggles of Night</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.</p>
