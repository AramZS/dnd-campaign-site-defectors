<p>At will: <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>minor illusion</em>, <em>vicious mockery</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Illusory Appearance</strong></em>. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</p>
<p><em><strong>Invisible Passage</strong></em>. The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.</p>

<p><em><strong>Change Shape</strong></em>. The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Etherealness</strong></em>. The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a <em>heartstone</em> in her possession.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)</strong></em>. While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A <em>protection from evil and good</em> spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a <em>magic circle</em>. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's <em>soul bag</em>. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the <em>greater restoration</em> spell or similar magic.</p>

<p><em><strong>Amphibious</strong></em>. The hag can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><em><strong>Horrific Appearance</strong></em>. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.</p>

<p>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</p>
