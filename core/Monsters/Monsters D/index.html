<p><em><strong>Echolocation</strong></em>. The darkmantle can't use its blindsight while deafened.</p>
<p><em><strong>False Appearance</strong></em>. While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.</p>
<h6 id="actions" tabindex="-1">Actions</h6>
<p><em><strong>Crush</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.</p>
<p>While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.</p>
<p>A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Darkness Aura (1/Day)</strong></em>. A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.</p>

<p><em><strong>Shapechanger</strong></em>. The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ambusher</strong></em>. The doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.</p>
<p><em><strong>Surprise Attack</strong></em>. If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.</p>
<h6 id="actions-22" tabindex="-1">Actions</h6>
<p><em><strong>Multiattack</strong></em>. The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slam</strong></em>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6+4) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read Thoughts</strong></em>. The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.</p>
