<p>Single mother, did not fit into Drow society. I spent my youth mostly with the spiders and the gnomes in the underdark. Fled the underdark at 87 and have been wandering as a bard for 10 years. Developed a taste for hallucinogens and discovered something on the other side of reality that occasionally talks to me. Particularly when I am intoxicated. It is maddening and it seems just beyond the border of my perception.</p>
