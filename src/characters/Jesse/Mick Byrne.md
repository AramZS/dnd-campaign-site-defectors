## Back Story

Born to a very suburban family of alchemists, Mick enjoyed a life of relative comfort.  However, with comfort came boredom.  He found that the alchemical skills passed on by his parents could be the cure for this boredom, namely through the creation of mind altering drugs.  When his enterprise finally caught the attention of the town guard, his parents decided to send him to a monastery to straighten him out.

He was a very mediocre student of the monk's martial tradition, but his alchemical skills made him very popular amongst both pupils and masters.  The leaders of the monastery felt that Mick's potions were a hindrance to self-discipline, and would lead to a deterioration of their traditions.  So, he was ejected from the monastery.

Now, with nothing but a few coins, his alchemical tools and the clothes on his back, he is alone and directionless.
