title: The Western Tier
description: The Western Tier is the most developed region of the west of Akercollis, far enough from The Cynosure to avoid even the smallest measure of control by its tyrants.

The Western Tier is the most developed region in western Akercollis. It has been developed over the centuries into two main kingdoms, Ainody'c and Sur. 

## Ainody'c 

The Ainodycians are considered the most magical people of Akercollis, the kingdom is smaller than its neighboring kingdom to the south or the loosely administrated region of The Furthest Reach to the north, but it is infused with power by the flow of The Meanders whose largest branches outside the Furthest Reach flow into its cities and villages who benefit from organized harvesting and damming of the sparkling clear water. As such, Ainody'c has more free access to magic than most kingdoms and a higher percent of magic users than almost anywhere else. This is likely the only reason it has managed to resist the constant attacks by Sur and as such has built up a military more focused on leveraging its magic users than on organization and traditional weapons of war. Its society is mostly organized around magic users with the ruling class entirely composed of citizens who can use magic. 

### The Sunken Capital - Caeritis 

After decades of on again and off again attacks by Sur, the capital city of Caeritis found itself too close to the no man's land between the two kingdoms. The chief wizard of Ainody'c, together with the generals of their army found a Great Spell and, after much study, sunk the capital deep into the ground a mere decade ago. The city is now surrounded by a waterless moat. The displaced soil became battlements, protected pathways, and deep walls that protect it from whatever creatures might live underground while spiking above the city to protect from siege weapons and casting much of the city in shadow. Unfortunately the power of the spell burnt up both the wizard and the book that contained the magic that allowed the city to be moved. It seems unlikely that Caeritis will ever sit on the surface again. The largest castle of the kingdom, and the king, reside here.

### The Ranks

The suburban area that sits between the furthest edge of Caeritis and the farms that provide food to the capital city. 

## No Man's Land

A wide-spanning burnt dangerous region between Ainody'c and Sur. Combat units roll back and forth across this front which has remained unmoved through the efforts of both sides for the last 80 years. Few people unaffiliated with a military remain. A large dry and mostly depleted branch of The Meanders river flows through this area. It once delineated the border between Ainody'c and Sur. 

## Sur 

Distant Sur is a region of tradition, and strict rulers. It has both vast uninhabitable regions and wealthy green ones over which it rules. Sur is known for its acquisitive martial class and aggressive expansion. It has been over 25 years since anyone has seen the Tsarina who rules Sur but no one doubts her power or the force and effectiveness of the Imperial Guard which administrates the kingdom. 

### Avon, the Rolling City

Ainody'c has become expert in magic-based guerrilla strikes inside the border of Sur. After an attack which decimated the large royal family, the capital city of Tagas (still a thriving and major city) was abandoned by the royals who have taken to the roads of Sur, slowly building a larger and larger retinue of hanger-ons, ever growing wagons, draft creatures, servants and an ever changing and slowly growing set of rolling belfry towers that see endless armor improvements and occasional magical enhancements to protect their residents, the royal family, most of whom are in permanent isolation from the outside world. A border of Imperial Guard ride ahead and behind, helping to keep the exact location of the royal family unknown. Many a trader has seen the oncoming wave of black stallions and turned away, adding many days to their trip rather than chance execution for stumbling upon some state secret.
