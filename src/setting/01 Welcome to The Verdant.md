The Verdant is a vast plane of existence that sits among what some might call the Fantasy realms. It is similar to the world of traditional Dungeons and Dragons and pretty much anything in **The Player's Handbook** is here as well. It's a place of travel, conflict and adventure. 

No steam engines exist and nothing beyond the basic gearwork you might find in a crossbow or, if you find someone particularly wealthy, a wind-up pocket-watch. 

Magic is all around, major cities use it as part of their every day operation, and magic users aren't rare, but it hasn't become a utility for everyone. The vast forests, mountains and plains of The Verdant are filled with many small and even some medium-sized towns that have never, or rarely, met a sorcerer, warlock or wizard. If they see you, they'll be impressed. 

Many a Great Spell has set up a town, city, or kingdom, but those Great Spells, the type that can raise a wall, bury a city, or lay out a street grid, have mostly been lost to time. Magic that can make big changes to the world have mostly been forgotten, lost or mangled over the years. Yet... they are not unrecoverable and in the deep dungeons of the old cities they may still sit, hidden and protected by their users', wizards whose names have mostly been lost to time. 

Unlike some other planes, conflict and contact with other dimensions is not unknown, though it is rare. The Great Old Ones sit beyond the borders of The Verdant and have been known to cause chaos and destruction to those planes and people that have meddled too deeply with the borders between worlds. Yet, they persist, unknowable in their motives and actions, yet occasionally bringing fortune or disaster. Beyond the knowable borders of existence their attention may not be something you wish to attract. 

Day to day magical artifacts exist. It isn't strange to find a farmer with a self-driving plow that was passed on from generation to generation, or a high class baron with an [Immovable Rod](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:immovable-rod) or a magic ring. Of course magic swords and dark tomes are scattered about, left behind by unfortunate adventurers. See that if you choose to recover their goods you do not end up sharing their fate. 

Conflict within The Verdant is a fact of life. Sometimes a duel is the only way to solve an argument. Monsters roam areas that still are not secured against them, including most towns without the help of adventurers like you. While there are many Kingdoms in The Verdant many are at peace, some are not. Even occasional border skirmishes between otherwise peaceful kingdoms are not unknown.

The Verdant is a vast world, but you don't know it all. Instead you reside on the large continent known as Akercollis, a still not fully explored region.

The northern border is The Vast Archipelago, a strange sea of planer exploration which many have become lost in. A stretch of ungovernable and strange changing land known as The Borderlands sits between it and The Furthest Reach, a large region of adventure and reward. The Furthest Reach is best known for being the source of The Meanders, a river that flows out of its extra-planer border and branches into the nearby regions, bringing with it a current of magic. It is also the source of a magical vein of quartz that has become the core strength of its government, which resides in the strange capital The Quartz City. 

The western border is The Great Ocean. A sea so vast none (you know of) have yet traversed it. Sitting on that border is the region known as The Western Tier, on which sits two great kingdoms. To the south is Sur, a region of tradition, and strict rulers. Sur is known for its acquisitive martial class and aggressive expansion. To the north, with one border against The Furthest Reach and one against Sur, is Ainody'c, one of the most magic-infused kingdoms where the ruling class has traditionally been magic users and they have used it to bring great riches and fame to their kingdom. The two kingdoms have been fighting on and off (currently: on) for decades and have a burnt dangerous No Man's Land between them. 

The east and south borders are far beyond where you have traveled but are The Latk, a ocean that, while still not fully explored, is regularly traversed by citizens of Akercollis, and beyond it lie other continents with which trade and travel is rare and difficult, but rewarding. 

The area in which you have resided your whole lives and begin is The West. It is mostly mapped but vast regions of that map lack detail and may be filled in by adventurers and expeditions. Regular travel passes through the unexplored center via carefully maintained and well-used trade routes. 

Near the center of Akercollis, far distant from most of The West is The Interior, a highly developed region with many small kingdoms, baronies and fiefdoms. Ruling it all is the deeply feared Cynosure, a city-state as old as memory, ruled with an iron fist by a small group of mysterious tyrants whose name is synonymous with their city. The Cynosure seek always to expand their power. Law and order is strongly held by the Cynosure over The Interior and many a resident is chafed by the magic law keepers who patrol The Interior. It is distant, and mostly to be avoided by any who wish to live free.
