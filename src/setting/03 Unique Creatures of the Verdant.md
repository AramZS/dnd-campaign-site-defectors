## Daemon Dog

*Medium extraplanar monstrosity, neutral*

The Daemon Dogs arrived the first time the dimensional stability of The Verdant was disturbed by extra-planer creatures and refugees. They are especially well known around the Riverwalk, where the plane bleeds into multidimensional space but lately have been seen everywhere. Some have speculated the dogs are a kind of immune response system for dimensional breeches. They are most likely to attack creatures who have crossed into this dimension or those who have been near such creatures.

They have monstrously large blunt heads and green slits for eyes. They have slick spiky bodies that have an otherworldly sheen. Their mouths are enormous spiky slits with interlocking spikes and when they open the mouth all that is visible behind those spikes is a whirling green void.

***Dimensional Bleed Senses***. The dog has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.

Uses rules from **Death Dog**.

## Frost Light

*Medium undead fey, neutral evil*

These creatures are an ice blue and usually coated with ice. They are created when a creature loses all hope as the result of an interaction with a being from beyond our dimension.

**Armor Class** 14

**Hit Points** 49 (11d8)

**Speed** 25 ft., Climb 35 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 8 (-1) | 18 (+4) | 10 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 20 (+5) | 7 (+2) |

**Saving Throws** Dex +5, Wis +8

**Skills** Deception +10, Perception +8, Sleight of Hand +7, Stealth +10

**Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons

**Senses** darkvision 90 ft., passive Perception 18

**Languages** None

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

***Spear Cluster***. The Frost Light usually possesses a collection of floating ice spears: trophies from previous conquests transformed into weapons. If a frost light dies, any spears in its possession disappear and the creatures to whom they belong regain those passions. If a creature the spears were stolen from has since become a frost light, the returned spears just add to their own collection. A frost light can spend its a spear as 5th-level spell slots, but will only do so if its life depends on it. The average frost light has 1d6 spears in its collection. An expended spear does 5d4+5 damage and always hits.

***Spellcasting.*** The frost light is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The frost light has four 4th-level spell slots available and the following spells prepared:

1st level: *bane, fog cloud, inflict wounds*

2nd level: *blindness/deafness, hold person*

3rd level: *bestow curse*

4th level (4 slots): *confusion, greater invisibility*

### Actions

***Misery.*** A target within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or take 16 (2d10 + 5) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll, saving throw, or death save they make. On a successful save the target only takes half damage and does not suffer the disadvantage.

***Loveless (1/day).*** The frost light targets one humanoid it can see within 60 feet, reading their passions and choosing which one to consume. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or its love of a thing (be it a person, place, activity, or subject) begins to wane. Once the creature has failed 3 times, they lose all interest in the subject, and the frost light adds a spear to its collection.

Once a target has lost three hearts to the frost light, they begin to transform into a frost light themself; if they don't have one of their hearts returned within one moon cycle, the transformation becomes permanent and can only be undone with the *wish* spell

## Quartz Men

Refer to Golem, Iron for rules. But they are made of quartz.

## Skelekron

*Medium undead, unaligned*

Near the caves that source minerals to the Quartz City the mineral deposits can take root and grow into dangerous crystal growths, infesting skeletons and turning them into mindless, but dangerous, undead.

**Armor Class** 13 (crystal growth)

**Hit Points** 26 (4d8 + 4)

**Speed** 30 ft.

| STR  | DEX   | CON   | INT   | WIS    | CHA   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
|    10 (+0)    |    14 (+2)    |  15 (+2)      |   6 (-2)     |    10 (+0)     |  8 (-1)    |

**Damage Immunities** poison, special (see below)

**Condition Immunities** exhaustion, poisoned

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10

**Language**s understands all languages it knew in life but cannot speak

**Challenge** 1/4 (100 XP)

**_Living Light Crystals._** Choose or roll a d6 to randomly select one energy type from the below list. The skelekron has immunity to this damage type. The skelekronâ€™s crystal growths also glow with a light colored to match.

1.  Radiant (opalescent)
2.  Acid (green)
3.  Fire (red)
4.  Cold (white)
5.  Lightning (yellow)
6.  Thunder (blue)

If an attack or effect deals damage to the skelekron that it is immune to, its Elemental Discharge attack recharges.

**_Detonate._** If the skelekron has its Elemental Discharge attack available when it reaches 0 hit points, it detonates. Every creature within 5 feet of the skelekron must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity save or take 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) damage of the type the skelekron is currently immune to.

### Actions

**_Multiattack._** The skelekron makes a Slam attack and an Elemental Discharge attack if it is able.

**_Slam._** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to attack, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

**_Elemental Discharge (Recharge Special)._** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to attack, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 3 (1d6) damage of the type the skelekron is currently immune to.

### Reactions

**_Elemental Adaptation._** As a reaction, the skelekron can change to being immune to the damage type it just took damage from, provided it was one of the types listed on the table under Living Light Crystals. Doing so also recharges Elemental Discharge.

## Witchlight

Powerful warlocks who access their
power by tapping into the Living Light energies that
seep into the fey realm.

Witchlights keep a loose affiliation, convening
periodically to discuss the lay of the land and their
agenda. They burn searing brands into stones and trees
as cautions, and advice, for other witchlights to find

**Innate Spellcasting.** The witchlightâ€™s spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 17). They can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: alter self, jump, silent image, mage armor
1/day each: astral projection, demiplane, prismatic spray, true
seeing

**Spellcasting.** The witchlight is an 18th-level spellcaster. Their
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,
+9 to hit with spell attacks). They know the following
warlock spells:

Cantrips (at will): *dancing lights, eldritch blast, friends, minor
illusion*

1st-5th level (4 5th-level slots): <em>color spray, dimension door,
enthrall, faerie fire, hypnotic pattern, mirror image*, blur*,
moonbeam, blink, major image*, greater invisibility*,
resilient sphere, arcane hand, flame strike</em>

*When the witchlight uses a spell slot for any of these spells
they can make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw and regain
the spell slot used on a success.

*Witch Sight.* The witchlight can see the true form of any
shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or
transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of
them and within line of sight.

### Actions

*Living Light Whip*. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
10 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) radiant damage. Damage
against objects is maximized.

*Living Light Eldritch Blast.* Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit,
range 120 ft., up to two targets. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) force
damage and one target takes an additional 7 (2d6) radiant
damage.

*Light Command (1/day)*. The witchlight casts prismatic spray
without expending a spell slot. When cast in this way they
choose up to 5 affected targets and select which color ray
(from results 1-7) affect them.

*Light Walk (1/day)*. The witchlightâ€™s movement becomes
100 feet, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and can
move through creatures. They leave a stream of light behind
them as they move and they cannot re-enter any space they
have already been in this turn. Each creature the witchlight
passes through takes 7 (1d6 + 4) radiant damage. Once the
witchlight moves 100 feet or damages 10 creatures this effect
ends. If they end this effect in a space they cannot occupy they
are moved to the nearest available space.

### Reactions

*Light Die Flash.* When the witchlight damages a creature
with radiant or force damage it can use a reaction to force
the creature to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or
be blinded for 1 minute on a failure. The target can repeat
this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
condition on a success.
