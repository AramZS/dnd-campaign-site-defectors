title: The Furthest Reach
description: The Furthest Reach is the ultimate border town, a strange and dangerous area patrolled by The Quartz Men, where anything can happen, but opportunity abounds.

The Furthest Reach is the area of The Verdant that sits on its north western border and abuts Borderlands, an area where anyone can traverse and enter The Riverwalk across which they can pass out of this plane into The Vast Archipelago of nearby dimensions.  

The Furthest Reach includes many areas. Here are just a few:

## Caradtas
The Elvish border town sits just outside the Riverwalk and is a small town that welcomes all. Some believe that the elfish folk are not actually native to The Verdant and that this was their first colony.  If that is true or not has long since stopped mattering, the elves are all about The Verdant now and have been for as long as anyone can remember. Caradtas is, however, quite old, at least the parts of it that have survived aggressive travelers, dangerous incursions, and the occasional overflowing tavern brawl. 

## Draysward 

The Draysward is a large area where The Meanders river has branched throughout, making it an excellent place for agriculture. The area is spotted with small towns, farms, and well-maintained resting stops. The high and sometimes magical growth rate of plants and animals in this area mean that these areas do see the occasional monster and may need guarding on full moons. In addition, it is a place that draws Visitors, the extra-planer beings who occasionally pass through The Furthest Reach, sometimes for good, sometimes for ill. As the breadbasket of The Furthest Reach they have much trade with The Quartz City but are distant enough that they only very occasionally benefit from patrols of The Quartz Men. As such the towns of the Draysward have become a hot bed for expatriates of The Western Tier's kingdoms, adventurers with little inclination to fight for either of the two sides and deserters looking to take their training and make it rich.

## The Deep

The Quartz City administrates a quarry of magical quartz with strange and abnormal properties that has become both essential to the construction and day to day operation of the city, as well as a major export of the region. What else may be uncovered by the Quartz City's endless mining? 

## The Torn Towns 

For every village that has thrived in The Furthest Reach another has found itself torn apart, burnt to the ground, or otherwise destroyed. There is much of value for those who succeed, many will become rich, but the broken remains of those who fail still litter the Reach.
