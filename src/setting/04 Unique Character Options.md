## THE SPRINGENFOLK

The springenfolk are a sophisticated people, tall, elegant, and highly intellectual. They are inesectoid creatures, usually looking similar to a mortal cricket, grasshopper or preying mantis. They all are born with four arms and have delicate build and graceful gesttures. Their many limbs move languidly but their eyes and antenna are in constant motion giving an impression they see everything.  Their coloration tends to be a light green to a deep brown. Their arrival in The Verdant was long ago as refugees from some distant plane, believed to have been consumed. They are scholars with a zeal for cultural enrichment.

### Refined Tastes

Springenfolk are a people of culture and sophistication. They are known for their love of art, music, and literature. They are also known for their love of food and drink. They are omnivores and will eat almost anything, but they have a particular fondness for sweets and strong drink.

### Masters of Nature

The springenfolk are fascinated by the natural order of the world: they immerse themselves in study of history, science and the arcane. They have a tendency towards planning at the expense of action.

### Springenfolk Traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2 and your Strength score increases by 1.

**Age**. Springenfolk reach maturity around the same age as humans but live to 200 on average.

**Alignment**. Springenfolk tend to neutral alignments, preferring to seek knowledge and sophistication and to let others worry about just causes and political domination.

**Size**. Springenfolk are much taller than humans, averaging at seven feet tall, but appear spindly. Your size is medium.

**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

**Springing Folk**. Your long limbs are perfectly adapted for making long leaps. The distance for your Long Jump and High Jump increases by your Strength modifier (minimum 1). Additionally, you may spend your entire movement for a turn to jump a distance equal to your base movement. You cannot use this trait again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.

**Lore Masters**. You have proficiency in the History and Arcana skills.

**Fey Magics**. You know the dancing lights and mending cantrips and can cast them without material components. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

**Multiple Arms**. You have four arms. You can hold up to four items at once, and you can interact with objects around you as a bonus action. The extra arms do not allow you to take extra actions, attacks or gain extra benefits from equipment.

## Warlock: Living Light Patron

Warlocks with a Living Light patron have been
chosen as vessels of order, though the intelligence that
defines that order is alien and inscrutable.

### Living Light Channel

At 1st level, you can ignite your connection to the Living
Light as a bonus action. For 1 minute your damage with
weapon attacks becomes radiant damage and all your
radiant or force damage against objects is maximized.
Once you use this feature you must complete a short or
a long rest before you use it again. At 10th level, once
per turn when you hit with a weapon attack you deal an
additional 1d8 radiant damage.

### Light Dice

At 1st level, you gain a number of d6s equal to your
warlock level divided by 3, rounded up (see table at left).
These are your Light Dice. You can expend these dice to
gain several different benefits:

- You can expend and roll a Light Die to generate a
dazzling display of lights. You can add the result
of the roll to a Charisma (Performance) check or
a Wisdom (Perception) check if such a display would
benefit it. If the display would benefit a
different type of skill check, your GM may choose
to allow it.

- You can expend a Light Die to increase the radius
and light level of a light source within 60 feet.
Dim light becomes bright light and the radius of
the light doubles for 1 hour.

- When you deal radiant or force damage to a
creature, you can expend and roll one Light Die,
adding the result to the damage for that creature.
At 10th level you can expend and roll 2 dice.

- When you deal radiant or force damage to a
creature, you can expend 2 Light Dice to force
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw
against your Warlock spell save DC or be blinded
for 1 minute on a failure. The target can
repeat this saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the condition on a success.
You regain your Light Dice on the completion of
a short or long rest.

### Trick of the Light

Starting at 6th level, youâ€™ve learned to
channel the Living Light to power your
illusions. When you cast an illusion spell
that does no damage and does not apply
a condition to another creature, you
can make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw. If you succeed, you
regain the expended spell slot.
Each time you use this feature after the
first, the DC increases by 2. When you finish
a short or long rest, the DC resets to 12.

### Light Walk

Starting at 10th level, you gain resistance to
radiant damage. In addition, as an action you
can become Living Light. Until the end of
your turn your movement becomes 100
feet, you do not provoke attacks of
opportunity from movement, and
you are able to pass through creatures.
You leave a stream of light behind you
as you move and you are unable to re-enter any space
you have already been in this turn. Any creature
you pass through or touch during this turn takes
radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Once you have moved a total of 100 feet
or dealt damage to 10 creatures this way, the
effect ends. If you end this effect in a space you
cannot occupy, you are shunted to the nearest
available space. Once you use this feature
you must complete a long rest before you use
it again.

### Light Command

At 14th level, prismatic spray counts as a warlock spell
for you and may be selected as your Mystic Arcanum.
Additionally, you can cast prismatic spray once per long
rest without expending your 7th-level Mystic Arcanum.
When cast in this way you can choose a number of
affected targets equal to your Charisma modifier.
Instead of rolling you can choose which color of ray
affects them, choosing from results 1-7. Once you have
used this feature you must complete a long rest before
you can use it again.
