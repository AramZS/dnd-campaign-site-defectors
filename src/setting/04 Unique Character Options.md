## THE SPRINGENFOLK

The springenfolk are a sophisticated people, tall, elegant, and highly intellectual. They are inesectoid creatures, usually looking similar to a mortal cricket, grasshopper or preying mantis. They all are born with four arms and have delicate build and graceful gesttures. Their many limbs move languidly but their eyes and antenna are in constant motion giving an impression they see everything.  Their coloration tends to be a light green to a deep brown. Their arrival in The Verdant was long ago as refugees from some distant plane, believed to have been consumed. They are scholars with a zeal for cultural enrichment.

### Refined Tastes

Springenfolk are a people of culture and sophistication. They are known for their love of art, music, and literature. They are also known for their love of food and drink. They are omnivores and will eat almost anything, but they have a particular fondness for sweets and strong drink.

### Masters of Nature

The springenfolk are fascinated by the natural order of the world: they immerse themselves in study of history, science and the arcane. They have a tendency towards planning at the expense of action.

### Springenfolk Traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2 and your Strength score increases by 1.

**Age**. Springenfolk reach maturity around the same age as humans but live to 200 on average.

**Alignment**. Springenfolk tend to neutral alignments, preferring to seek knowledge and sophistication and to let others worry about just causes and political domination.

**Size**. Springenfolk are much taller than humans, averaging at seven feet tall, but appear spindly. Your size is medium.

**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 35 feet.

**Springing Folk**. Your long limbs are perfectly adapted for making long leaps. The distance for your Long Jump and High Jump increases by your Strength modifier (minimum 1). Additionally, you may spend your entire movement for a turn to jump a distance equal to your base movement. You cannot use this trait again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.

**Lore Masters**. You have proficiency in the History and Arcana skills.

**Fey Magics**. You know the dancing lights and mending cantrips and can cast them without material components. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

**Multiple Arms**. You have four arms. You can hold up to four items at once, and you can interact with objects around you as a bonus action. The extra arms do not allow you to take extra actions, attacks or gain extra benefits from equipment.

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan and one additional language of your choice.

## Warlock: Living Light Patron

Warlocks with a Living Light patron have been
chosen as vessels of order, though the intelligence that
defines that order is alien and inscrutable.

### Living Light Channel

At 1st level, you can ignite your connection to the Living
Light as a bonus action. For 1 minute your damage with
weapon attacks becomes radiant damage and all your
radiant or force damage against objects is maximized.
Once you use this feature you must complete a short or
a long rest before you use it again. At 10th level, once
per turn when you hit with a weapon attack you deal an
additional 1d8 radiant damage.

### Light Dice

At 1st level, you gain a number of d6s equal to your
warlock level divided by 3, rounded up (see table at left).
These are your Light Dice. You can expend these dice to
gain several different benefits:

- You can expend and roll a Light Die to generate a
dazzling display of lights. You can add the result
of the roll to a Charisma (Performance) check or
a Wisdom (Perception) check if such a display would
benefit it. If the display would benefit a
different type of skill check, your GM may choose
to allow it.

- You can expend a Light Die to increase the radius
and light level of a light source within 60 feet.
Dim light becomes bright light and the radius of
the light doubles for 1 hour.

- When you deal radiant or force damage to a
creature, you can expend and roll one Light Die,
adding the result to the damage for that creature.
At 10th level you can expend and roll 2 dice.

- When you deal radiant or force damage to a
creature, you can expend 2 Light Dice to force
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw
against your Warlock spell save DC or be blinded
for 1 minute on a failure. The target can
repeat this saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the condition on a success.
You regain your Light Dice on the completion of
a short or long rest.

### Trick of the Light

Starting at 6th level, you’ve learned to
channel the Living Light to power your
illusions. When you cast an illusion spell
that does no damage and does not apply
a condition to another creature, you
can make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw. If you succeed, you
regain the expended spell slot.
Each time you use this feature after the
first, the DC increases by 2. When you finish
a short or long rest, the DC resets to 12.

### Light Walk

Starting at 10th level, you gain resistance to
radiant damage. In addition, as an action you
can become Living Light. Until the end of
your turn your movement becomes 100
feet, you do not provoke attacks of
opportunity from movement, and
you are able to pass through creatures.
You leave a stream of light behind you
as you move and you are unable to re-enter any space
you have already been in this turn. Any creature
you pass through or touch during this turn takes
radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Once you have moved a total of 100 feet
or dealt damage to 10 creatures this way, the
effect ends. If you end this effect in a space you
cannot occupy, you are shunted to the nearest
available space. Once you use this feature
you must complete a long rest before you use
it again.

### Light Command

At 14th level, prismatic spray counts as a warlock spell
for you and may be selected as your Mystic Arcanum.
Additionally, you can cast prismatic spray once per long
rest without expending your 7th-level Mystic Arcanum.
When cast in this way you can choose a number of
affected targets equal to your Charisma modifier.
Instead of rolling you can choose which color of ray
affects them, choosing from results 1-7. Once you have
used this feature you must complete a long rest before
you can use it again.

## Monk: Way of Pandemonium 
  
Monks of the Way of the Pandemonium use the kinetic energy gathered from the effects of force exuded upon them – i.e., impact, friction, pressure – and convert it into their ki to create booming explosions, rippling waves of sound, and painful effects on their enemies. They are a noisy and disorienting warrior on the battlefield, prone to great feats of athleticism and awe-inspiring efficiency. 

Those who follow the Way of the Pandemonium come from all backgrounds across all lands. They aren’t typically religious and their boisterous fighting style is, by no means, an indicator of an individual’s personality. Monks who follow this path usually don simple-cut robes with their limbs often bare; exposed to the forces naturally encountered on their travels. They do, however, appear to share a style of wearing intricate chains, bangles, cuffs, and earrings. Items, they say, that help them generate and draw upon the energy they imbue into their ki. For example, the twist of a ring causes friction, and the bounce of a pendant causes impact. 

When you adorn yourself (or your Combat Wheelchair) with these decorations, you can choose their appearance yourself or roll for it randomly on the Energy Trinkets table.

### Way of the Pandemonium Features
| Monk Level | Features |
| ---- | ---- |
| 3rd   | _Energy Centre, Off-Kilter, Frictional Ferocity_ |
| 6th | _Sonic Barrage_ |
| 11th | _Playback_ |
| 17th | _Cacophonous Din_ |
#### Energy Trinkets

Consider your monk’s way of dress, what tastes they may have in fashion. Perhaps their heritage may also influence the style of jewelry or trinkets they prefer to wear about their person. You can also pick or roll randomly on the following table if you’d prefer.

| d8 | Trinkets |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | _Fine chains with charms of crystal that jingle._ |
| 2 | _Rings with mechanical moving parts._ |
| 3 |   _Leather bracelets and clattering wooden beads._ |
| 4 |   _Earrings with hooped, loose pendants._ |
| 5 |  _Necklaces with beads and small tinkling bells._ |
| 6 |  _Loose-ftting anklets with clicking glass pendants._ |
| 7 | _Copper and brass bangles that jangle loudly._ |
| 8 |   _Bronze chain-link belts that rattle._ |
####   Energy Centre
  
At 3rd level, you can spend 15 minutes once per day to draw on the energy trinkets you wear about your person to regain 1 ki point. You can only use this feature is you have already used 1 or more of your ki points and can’t stack them in order to exceed the amount of ki you have that is determined by your monk level. 

When you reach 17th level, you can use this feature twice per day. You still can’t exceed your ki level in this manner.  
#### **Off-Kilter**

At 3rd level, you can spend 1 additional ki point when using your _Flurry of Blows_ to transfer the flow of energy gathered by the impact absorbed by your feet or your chair’s wheels on the ground into a ripple of force that imbues your attack. The target creature must make a Dexterity save – the DC equal to your ki save DC – as their very bones are rattled. On a failure, the creature crumples to the ground, falling prone. 

The sound produced by this wave is a distorted bend of noise, like a drumbeat played in reverse.
####  **Frictional Ferocity**

Starting at 3rd level, you can manipulate the energy gathered from friction – from pushing your wheelchair, handling your weapons, even saddle sores from a long period of riding a mount. When you hit a creature with an _Unarmed Strike_, you can spend 1 ki point to deal additional fire damage equal to one roll of your martial arts die. If the creature is incapacitated, vulnerable, or made from plant matter, the creature takes fire damage equal to three rolls of your martial arts die instead. 

So long as you have enough ki points to spend, you can use this feature once on each of your turns.

#### **Sonic Barrage**

At 6th level, you harness the energy gathered from knocks and blows made against you. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to blast this energy out of you in a cracking sonic boom that snaps through the air. 

This blast extends out from you in a 10ft radius and can’t penetrate total cover. Each creature in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw – the DC equal to your ki save DC – or take 2d8 thunder damage, half as much on a success. If the creature fails, they have disadvantage on their next attack made against you.

#### **Playback**

Beginning at 11th level, you have mastered absorbing energy from forces thrust upon you by outside sources when in battle – for example, attacks from your enemies. When a melee weapon or spell attack next successfully hits you, you can spend 1 ki point to use your reaction to only take half of the resulting damage and fling the remaining half back at a target you can see within 30ft of you. 

If the initial attack requires you to make a saving throw against a condition, the target creature you throw the remaining damage onto must also make the saving throw 

– DC being equal to your ki save DC – or be subjected to the condition too. 

You can choose how this volley of energy is returned back to your target – perhaps you channel it into one arm before throwing a mean pitch, or perhaps you feed it into one of your chair’s rear wheels before pivoting to throw it with momentum. 

The sound this energy makes as you volley it is akin to the crack of a whip but amplified tenfold.
#### **Cacophonous Din**

At 17th level, your control over energy conversion allows you to create an overwhelmingly loud and jarring explosion of discordant sounds. When you next make a successful attack against a creature, you can expend 4 ki points to unleash a devastating blast of sound and energy. 

The target creature must make a Constitution saving throw – DC equal to your ki save DC – with disadvantage. On a failure, it takes six of your martial arts die’s worth of force damage and is Stunned until it can succeed the saving throw. Whilst stunned, all attacks made against the creature have advantage. If the creature succeeds the save, they take half damage and aren’t stunned. 

Additionally, after passing through the initial target, this exploding wave of sound continues rippling out in a 30ft radius. Each creature within this range – including allies but not yourself – must make a Dexterity saving throw or be thrown 5ft away and fall prone, the DC equal to your ki save DC. On a success, a creature is only pushed 5ft away from you.

##### Deaf or Hard of Hearing

Though your attacks in this subclass often use sound, they can and will still affect creatures that are deaf or hard of hearing (HoH). Instead of hearing the resulting sound, they will experience the physicality of the soundwaves produced by your releasing of harsh and powerful energy. Many deaf and HoH people in real life express discomfort at the _feeling_ of a very loud noise.
