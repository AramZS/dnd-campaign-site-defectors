The comedown is unpleasant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | best ingested via a tea                                                                                                                                               | No         | wandercaps                                           | rare           | seeing the future                                                                                      |             | small chance to get hints of future events                                                 | causes exhaustion.  Use is incapacitate for 1 hour after ingestion.                                                                                                                        |                                                        |
|               | Mordayn Vapor | Also known as Dream Mist. Made from the ground leaves of a rare herb found deep in the jungle. Taken by dipping in hot water and inhaling the vapor from the tea. The raw powder and the tea are both very potent poisons. Inhaling the vapor causes intense hallucinations (albeit happy and beautiful ones). Drinking the tea or eating the powder causes 7d10 poison damage and 2d10 psychic damage. It is very illegal in every region of the world.                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                       | No         | Emerald dream leaves                                 | rare           |                                                                                                        |             |                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                        |

|               | Grellsvice    | A drug usually administered as an oral capsule made from the spikes at the end of a grell’s tentacles. Effects last for roughly two hours on a regular 200 mg dose, and leave the user with a four-hour hangover of sorts. The main draw to grellsvice is a tingling sense in the muscles and extra-sensitive motor functionality. This comes with a strong euphoric rush whenever a new body part is moved. The drawback is the lack of motor functionality during the hangover and the incredibly dulled sense of touch accompanied with it. |                                                                                                                                                                       | No         | Grell tentacle, capsules                             | uncommon       | Recreational.
