title: The Quartz City
description: The Quartz City, city of changelings, is the city closest to where you begin and the largest in the area of The Verdant known as The Furthest Reach.
---

It is the core urban area of The Furthest Reach that sits back from the Borderlands, this is the first place anyone crossing from the extra-planer Riverwalk to the center of The Verdant would encounter that is a true population center. It has built up over the centuries due to its reputation for safety and the fortunes that wash up (sometimes literally) from beyond The Verdant plane. As a border city it is built as a bastion, surrounded by a half sphere of magically-enhanced and almost perfectly transparent Quartz.  

The border of the sphere and high towers that peak up above the multi level city occasionally flicker with a gleaming light.

The highest towers seem especially precarious sitting atop multiple levels of habitation, markets, and active squares, the city narrowing up like a round Aztec pyramid with a base of hovels and an ever increasing clean gleam as the levels progress upward. 

Within you can just barely distinguish the various levels including, at the very center, the elevated tower in which sits the seat of government for The Furthest Reach, a building known as The Quartz Heart. 

Sitting tight up against the outer walls are small batches of camps and markets overflowing with activity. People scramble back and forth, trading occurs in hushed voices and all look towards the main portal in the wall where Quartz Men stand four across and four deep, guarding an official at a table who is slowly processing people into the city, checking them, examining their faces and bodies, and rifling through their belongings.

The Quartz City is also known as The City of Changelings. By intent or accident, a good number of The Verdant's people may walk the Planes, traversing out of this dimension and into others. Sometimes they return with interesting goods and even more interesting stories. More often it is their children who come back, and sometimes with strange features or abilities. These cross-planer citizens, known as Changelings are repatriated to Quartz City with open arms for the most part, where the citizens of the city are used to the strange, the magical and the new. However sometimes the strangeness isolates them when they travel outside The Furthest Reach where their kind is less known and, as a result, occasionally feared. But the changelings are not inherently evil and any willing to abide by the Law of the Quartz City are welcome. As a result, most of The Verdant's changeling population resides in Quartz City.
