### How to use this site

This is a dedicated website with all the main reference materials you need for your campaign.

You can find most of the core rule information under the **Core Rules** section in the navigation. This is pulled from what Wizards of the Cost has made publicly available so some things, especially higher level spells, or deeper details about particular character class features may be missing, especially if you pulled character details from anything other than the *Player's Handbook*.

Rough, and probobly unfinished, notes and information about your characters will be in the **Characters** section in the navigation. These are built out of my notes about your characters so they will be updated as we play with special skills, narrative hooks you may have activated, and grammatically terrible notes on what you told me about your character or what you have done.

We're playing in a homebrew custom setting called **The Verdant** a plane that sits outside of the normal D&D rules and resources, but pulls much from it. You can assume most default information in the *Player's Handbook* applies unless I have told you otherwise, but you can go to the **Setting** section to learn about the world, who and what is in it, and how you've interacted with it and changed things--for the better or (knowing you bunch) for the worse.
