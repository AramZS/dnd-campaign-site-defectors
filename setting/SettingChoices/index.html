<li>Generic Straight Down the Line D&amp;D - Goblins, Bars, Medieval level Cities, etc...</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option 1 + Draculas - This is the dark D&amp;D generic setting. Normal Fantasy stuff, plus &quot;dark&quot; stuff like Draculas, Witcher-style monsters, lots of big spooky castles, maybe some early guns, spooky shit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homebrew setting: &quot;The Verdant&quot; - plane of existence centered around more monsters + Shakespearian fantasy elements + more modern cities, political structures and warfare - think more renaissance &amp; Venetian fantasy than feudalism. Also some more modern inspirational elements that pull from comics like Die, Rat Queens, and Goddess Mode + Lovecraftian Outer Plane beings that very very rarely might become involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homebrew Setting: &quot;The Front&quot; - same as option 2 + more mechanistic steam punk settings and a constant grinding war in the background and also some fun elements from Russian fantasy settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Darkest Fantasy - Setting 3, but Fallen. The war discussed in 4 has expanded beyond the borders, overrun all but a few bastions of civilization that are now struggling to survive, and now things are Falling Apart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player choice - you tell me and I custom homebrew it around your direction.</p>

<h2 id="setting-choices:" tabindex="-1">Setting Choices:</h2>
<ol>
<li>How dark - not much dark beyond it being fun to kill gobbys OR we got vampires OR <s>we are in a fallen plane of existence</s>
<ol>
<li>We got vamps, warewolves, Outer Creatures, [[Lovecraftian]] old gods.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Steampunky-ness - do you want guns? Are they steam and gears or are they magic?
<ol>
<li>No guns. More medieval - so basic gear-work stuff, auto cross-bows, you can find a watchmaker, nothing beyond this time period in real life + magic.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>How normal is magic in this world?
<ol>
<li>Magic is around, it isn't super rare. People see mages in their day to day lives, big cities are filled with magic users but small towns will be impressed. It's for adventuring but it doesn't pave the streets.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are wars, are they all around you, or somewhere over there and maybe you'll head in that direction one day?
<ol>
<li>Ongoing War - You all are draft dodgers</li>
</ol>
</li>
